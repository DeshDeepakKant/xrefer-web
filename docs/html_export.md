# XRefer HTML Exporter

The XRefer HTML Exporter allows you to export your analysis to an interactive HTML visualization that can be shared or viewed outside of IDA Pro.

## Features

- **Interactive Cluster Visualization**: Explore cluster relationships and function connections through an interactive graph.
- **Semantic Descriptions**: View natural language explanations generated by LLMs for each cluster.
- **Artifact Analysis**: Browse strings, APIs, libraries, and CAPA matches associated with each cluster.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices with a clean, modern interface.
- **Standalone**: The exported HTML package is self-contained and can be shared with others.

## Usage

### Exporting to HTML

1. First, run a complete XRefer analysis on your binary.
2. Go to `Edit -> XRefer -> Export -> Export to HTML`.
3. Select a destination directory for the HTML export.
4. A message will appear in the output window confirming the export.

### Viewing the Visualization

1. Open `index.html` from the export directory in any modern web browser.
2. Use the interactive controls to explore the cluster graph:
   - Click on nodes to see detailed information
   - Double-click clusters to expand/collapse them
   - Use the zoom controls to adjust your view
   - Search for specific functions or artifacts
   - Filter the display by artifact type

## Sharing the Results

The exported HTML visualization is completely self-contained and can be shared with others by simply sending them the export directory. This allows team members to explore the analysis results without needing IDA Pro or any additional software.

## Customization

The HTML visualization uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and can be customized if needed:

- `css/styles.css`: Modify the visual appearance
- `js/graph.js`: Adjust the graph rendering and behavior
- `js/ui.js`: Customize the user interface components

## Technical Details

The HTML exporter generates a JSON representation of your analysis data and packages it with a web application that renders the visualization. The visualization uses the following libraries:

- **Cytoscape.js**: For interactive graph visualization
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive UI components
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the interface

The generated HTML package follows the structure outlined below:

```
